      <p>I took my OJT at Kaohsiung, Taiwan through a Work Immersion Program conducted by Jose Rizal University in collaboration with
        National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology. We are able to get exposed on certain areas such as machine learning, facial
        recognition, IOT devices like LORA Technology, we also had an expounded knowledge on the different LED properties, and how it contributes
        to the development of Taiwan. It was a worthwhile experience for me. To be able to learn courses that could help more professionally
        ready while engaging with people with different nationalities is amazing.</p>
